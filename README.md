# WinkRedNode
Set of sample flows that shows how to use node-red and Quirky Wink api to automate home

In order to utilize this repository you need to have following:

 1. Working version of Node-Red instance - http://nodered.org/. 
 2. freeboard node installed (required to utilize dashboards). Optional. (http://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-freeboard)
 3. Wink API key

The way I set it up for now - each txt file in Flows subfolder is a text representation of a flow or set of flows for node-red. 
Please open the file and copy all it contents to the clipboard. Go to your Node Red flow editor, clink on 3 bars icon at the top right corner and select Import - Clipboard. This operation will paste the flow to the editor window.
